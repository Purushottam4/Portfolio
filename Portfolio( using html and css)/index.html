            <li><a href="#">Project 1: Portfolio Website</a>
            <p>A portfolio website made using only HTML and CSS is a static personal website that showcases your work, skills, and background. It includes sections like Home, About Me, Projects, Skills, and Contact. HTML creates the structure (like text, images, and links), while CSS styles everything with colors, fonts, layout, and responsiveness. There is no backend, JavaScript, or interactivity like form submission or animations. It’s mainly for beginners or students to practice front-end development and display their work professionally. This kind of portfolio is perfect for resumes, internship applications, and learning web design basics.

            </p></li>
            <li><a href="#">Project 2: E-commerce Site</a>
            <p>
                An e-commerce website built using only HTML and CSS is a static, front-end design of an online store. It includes pages like home, product listings, product details, and a contact section. You can display images, prices, and buttons, but it doesn’t include real functionality like shopping cart, login, search, or payment processing. This type of website is mainly used for practicing web design skills, creating a portfolio project, or presenting a layout to clients or developers before adding real features using JavaScript and backend tools. It's ideal for beginners in web development.
            </p></li>
            <li><a href="#">Project 3: Blogging Platform</a> 
            <p>
                A blogging platform website using only HTML and CSS is a static website that displays blog posts in a well-designed format. It includes a homepage with featured posts, an about section, and individual blog pages with titles, dates, author names, and content. HTML is used to structure the content, while CSS styles the layout, fonts, and colors. Since it uses no JavaScript or backend, users can’t write or submit posts — it’s just for displaying content. This type of site is perfect for beginners to learn how blogs are structured and to showcase web design skills.
